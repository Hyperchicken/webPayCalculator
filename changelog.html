            <li>Added support for part-time public holiday shifts that have converted to PH-roster. Part-timers who have
                had a shift convert to PH should enter in the sign-on/off times of the original shift and select the

            <li>Changed PH Extra Pay calculation to give a fixed payment of 8 hours (7.6 hours for trainee/part-time) as
                opposed to time worked. EA says time worked but payroll pays the fixed amount (which is arguably fairer
                overall).</li>
            <li>Fixed some instances where calculations were a few cents off.</li>
        </ul>

                fortnight.</li>
            <li>The page will now remember the most recent fortnight-commencing date and automatically load it (but not
                for fortnights in the past).</li>
            <li>Title and menu bar should no longer double in height on smaller screens. Menu-button text now
                automatically hides on small screens.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>14/01/2020 - Version 1.02

        <ul>
            <li>Adjusted rounding behaviour and fixed input validation highlighting bug when changing dates.</li>
            <li>Added 'hours worked'. The payslip's 'hours worked' does not reflect the real hours worked (it includes
                guarantee and annual leave for some reason??). I'll expand on this in a future update.</li>
            <li>Pay grades now save to the selected date.</li>
            <li>Fixed calculation error when working overtime on a Sunday past midnight.</li>
            <li>Added more visual time input validation.</li>
