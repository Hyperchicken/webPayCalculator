            <li>Fixed PH Extra Pay persisting after unselecting Public Holiday shift option.</li>
            <li>Removed calculation warning from Trainee pay grade.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>18/02/2020 - Version 1.06
        <ul>
            <li>Added support for part-time public holiday shifts that have converted to PH-roster. Part-timers who have
                had a shift convert to PH should enter in the sign-on/off times of the original shift and select the
                shift options 'Public Holiday' and 'PH Roster'.</li>
            <li>Added support for Public Holidays OFF-roster. New public holiday shift option button added.</li>
            <li>Minor text adjustments for better page-display.</li>
            <li>Position of EDO pay element in 'grouped' results view better matches payslips, and is now attached to a
                day in 'split-view'.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>06/02/2020 - Version 1.05
        <ul>
            <li>Changed PH Extra Pay calculation to give a fixed payment of 8 hours (7.6 hours for trainee/part-time) as
                opposed to time worked. EA says time worked but payroll pays the fixed amount (which is arguably fairer
                overall).</li>
            <li>Fixed some instances where calculations were a few cents off.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

                website went down briefly.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>22/01/2020 - Version 1.03
        <ul>
            <li>Improved fortnight-commencing functionality with updated layout and new buttons to quickly change
                fortnight.</li>
            <li>The page will now remember the most recent fortnight-commencing date and automatically load it (but not
                for fortnights in the past).</li>
            <li>Title and menu bar should no longer double in height on smaller screens. Menu-button text now
                automatically hides on small screens.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>14/01/2020 - Version 1.02
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed another calculation issue with weekend penalty calculation when working excess hours overtime.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>12/01/2020 - Version 1.01

            <li>Added Sick-Part calculation.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with weekend penalty calculation on Saturday shifts that work into Sunday.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>08/01/2020 - Version 1.00
        <ul>
            <li>Out of Beta and into version 1.00! ✨</li>

            <li>Fixed options buttons text-wrap issue on Chrome.</li>
            <li>Fixed Guarantee calculation with PH-OFF shifts.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>01/01/2020 🎆 - Version 0.70
        <ul>
            <li>Adjusted results table alignment.</li>
            <li>Fixed Bonus Pay button text colour bug.</li>
            <li>Various text/phrasing adjustments and corrections.</li>
            <li>Added temporary warning for Trainee and Conversion pay-grades.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <ul>
            <li>Adjusted rounding behaviour and fixed input validation highlighting bug when changing dates.</li>
            <li>Added 'hours worked'. The payslip's 'hours worked' does not reflect the real hours worked (it includes
                guarantee and annual leave for some reason??). I'll expand on this in a future update.</li>
            <li>Pay grades now save to the selected date.</li>
            <li>Fixed calculation error when working overtime on a Sunday past midnight.</li>
            <li>Added more visual time input validation.</li>
            <li>Restricted date selection to fortnightly instead of weekly.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
