                for fortnights in the past).</li>
            <li>Title and menu bar should no longer double in height on smaller screens. Menu-button text now
                automatically hides on small screens.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Adjusted rounding behaviour and fixed input validation highlighting bug when changing dates.</li>
            <li>Added 'hours worked'. The payslip's 'hours worked' does not reflect the real hours worked (it includes
                guarantee and annual leave for some reason??). I'll expand on this in a future update.</li>
            <li>Pay grades now save to the selected date.</li>
